# CRYPTOPALS SULUTIONS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES

My solutions to the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) problems

## Why?
Why not? 

## But this has already been done.
So what?

## Languages
+ Julia -- Because Julia Rocks. Just wish it had a proper debugger
+ Java  -- Because I write in Java daily
+ Python 2.7 -- Because I write in Python 2.7 daily
+ Python 3   -- Becasue I do not write in Pyton 3
+ Scala -- Why not need to do something different

## Builders
+ Travis CI
+ Maven
+ Gradel because I want to play with it
+ pybuilder Is there anything better
